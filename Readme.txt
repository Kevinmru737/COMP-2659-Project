Changes made since initial submissions:

Stage 1 (Game Specification):
	All relevant comments made to the inital specification submitted have been reviewed
	and implemented into the final specification document.
	
	Some of the major changes include:
		-Reorganzing the presentation of component introduction and explanations
		to be more concise with consistent structure.
	
		-Adding a "Initial Game State" section

		-Clearly defining scoring systems and rules in a separate section

		-More in depth object creation descriptions.

		-Rewording physics explanations

		-Redefining Object Properties/Behaviors to be more accurate and consistent

		-Trigger timing specificity added

		-Screenshots added and in-text citations are now included

		-Sound effects and Music are specified in more detail

Stages 2-4 (Raster Graphics, Events/Models, Rendering):

	Due to a major refactoring we did after/during stage 5, our submitted Stage 2-4
	test driver will not work with the final game code. We tweaked modules 2, 3, and 4
	and have been adding/removing as necessary as the stages have progressed.

Stages 5-7 (Animation, Double-Buffering, Sound):

	No major changes, small refactoring has been done but nothing substantial.
