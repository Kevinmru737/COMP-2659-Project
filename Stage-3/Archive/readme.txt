For this stage, we have not finished testing the collison system.


Also, The test driver has functions which tests different functionality of this stage( movement, initialization).
They are currently commented out. Since, our test functions print a lot of text to the console, we recommend that
you uncomment one function, compile using clean.g, and run the tst_mode driver. Basically, run one test funciton at a time.


Sorry for the confusion this may have caused
